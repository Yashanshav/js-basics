<!--
    Difference between innerHTML, innerContent, innerText?
    innerText -> reads text as it is renders on screen.
    innerContent -> reads text as it is markup, returns all the text whether it is rendered on screen or not, only deals with raw text and doesn't account for styles
    innerHTML -> it displays all the HTML tags also
-->

<!--
    How Node List and HTML Collection is different from arrays?
    Node List doesn't have forEach but not map functionality
    HTML Collection doesn't have forEach also
    But they can be converted to arrays, if we want to perform any array like operation on the dom selectors
